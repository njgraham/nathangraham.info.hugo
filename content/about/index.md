I've recently started working at [EquipmentShare](https://equipmentshare.com) as an automation engineer in Kansas City, Missouri.

Previously, I spent 5 years as a Systems/Software Engineer at the [University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC)](http://www.kumc.edu/) [Division of Medical Informatics](http://www.kumc.edu/ea-mi/medical-informatics.html).  My primary focus at KUMC has been [The Healthcare Enterprise Repository for Ontological Narration (HERON)](https://informatics.kumc.edu/work/wiki/HERON) which encompasses an [i2b2](https://www.i2b2.org/) instance loaded with various clinical data sources including the [Epic](http://www.epic.com) Electronic Medical Record system at KUMC hospital.  A subset of our work can be found on the public version of the [Medical Informatics Trac wiki](https://informatics.kumc.edu/work/).  Recently, I've been contributing to the [Greater Plains Collaborative](http://www.gpcnetwork.org/) funded by the [Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI)](http://www.pcori.org/).

Prior to working at KUMC, I spent a year and a half as a Technology Consultant at [Cerner Corporation](http://www.cerner.com) where I traveled all over the the United States primarily supporting [Cerner Point of Care](https://www.cerner.com/solutions/point-of-care) solutions.

Before Cerner, I spent 7 years at [Garmin](http://www.garmin.com) as an embedded software engineer.  I served two of those years as a team leader.  My team was responsible for [Garmin sensor products](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/oem/sensors-and-boards/cOEM-cSensorsAndBoards-p1.html) and support for low level hardware platform technologies such as NAND/NOR flash storage, file systems, Garmin proprietary operating system, USB, 3rd party processors and GPS chip sets.

I graduated from [Missouri University of Science and Technology](http://www.mst.edu) (known as "University of Missouri - Rolla" at the time) with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering.
